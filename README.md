## :thinking: How do I run the project on my machine?

The first step is to clone the project, either via terminal or GitHub Desktop, or even by downloading the compressed file (.zip). After that, go ahead.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Requirements

> There are no requirements to perform some of the exercises on your computer! Just double click on the file with extension *.html* and it will open in your default browser.
>
> However, to run some JavaScript files individually we need some tools.

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/).
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the extension [Node.js Exec](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miramac.vscode-exec-node).

### :sparkles: Running the JS files

Open the project folder in VSCode and, by right-clicking on the file with extension *.html*, choose *Run Code*. The Node output console will open with the code results.

## :tada: If everything went well...

Now you are running the project beautifully!
