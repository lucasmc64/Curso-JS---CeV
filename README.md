## Goal :dart:

These different small projects aim to exemplify and practice the basics of JavaScript, one of the languages of the moment.

## Some details :scroll:

### About the project :desktop_computer:

- The front-end is made with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

### About the course :book:

It is a basic course, but it is still complete given its target audience. Professor Gustavo Guanabara has great teaching skills and the course is available for free on the internet.

## How do I run the project on my machine? :thinking:

The first step is to clone the project, either via terminal or GitHub Desktop, or even by downloading the compressed file (.zip). After that, go ahead.

### Requirements :hammer_and_wrench:

> There are no requirements to perform some of the exercises on your computer! Just double click on the file with extension *.html* and it will open in your default browser.
>
> However, to run some JavaScript files individually we need some tools.

- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/).
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the extension [Node.js Exec](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miramac.vscode-exec-node).

### Running the JS files :sparkles:

Open the project folder in VSCode and, by right-clicking on the file with extension *.html*, choose *Run Code*. The Node output console will open with the code results.

## If everything went well... :tada:

Now you are running the project beautifully!
